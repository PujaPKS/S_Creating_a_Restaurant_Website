Task Details :-

So the items of the carts are used in multiple components in the website

1. In showing the number of cart Items next to the carticon https://drive.google.com/file/d/13TchLhjm_Ubj5Co5bKXVzLQXUaTqyfaW/view?usp=sharing
2. When the cart opens, cart Items are shown

A good design pattern to use is Context API so that the cart is accessible to all the components.


Deliverable :-

1. Tell me how does the reduce work
2. Without watching videos after 13 , can you try to make the cart Items work. Whenever the user adds an item in his order , the cart Item should get update. [ Hint- You just need to play with Context Api]
