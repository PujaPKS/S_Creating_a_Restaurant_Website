Deliverable

1. You had learnt about React.createportal() previously . Use that to build this https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_3zEu9cRIno287crU7CS-QSGWk1AfNLQ/view?usp=sharing. It is pretty simple i feel.
2. Hard code the contents of the cart.
3. When the user comes to the page the page should directly open .
4. You don't have to make the close and order button work.
5. We will do the functionality portion in the next task.
